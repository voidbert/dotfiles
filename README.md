# dotfiles

Configuration files for the software I use. I also developed some scripts and small functions for
everyday use, such as, but not limited to:

##### [Neovim](nvim)

- Asynchronous $`\LaTeX`$ compilation and preview
- [Termux](https://termux.dev) clipboard synchronization

##### [Swaywm](sway)

- Various shell scripts to complement sway's functionality
- Efficient system information retriever for `swaybar`
